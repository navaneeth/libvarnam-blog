First release of `libvarnam` is ready and it is in public beta. I got a full working implementation of transliteration and reverse transliteration for Malayalam. This version also has built-in learning capabilities. All public APIs are kind of finalized and stable. There are still some rough edges that needs more work. This will be fixed before the first release. Please clone [git://github.com/navaneeth/libvarnam.git](git://github.com/navaneeth/libvarnam.git) and let me know your feedback. Installation instructions are available at the [project page](https://github.com/navaneeth/libvarnam#readme)

Web interface for `libvarnam` is in progress. We should have something usable by this month end. Documentation would be the other area which needs some love.
